horse_mushroom,Agaricaceae,Europe and parts of North America and Asia,"Cap 8-20 cm diameter, stem 8-10 cm tall * 1.5-3 cm diameter","Agaricus arvensis, commonly known as the horse mushroom, is a sometimes massive agaric that has a white cap, ringed stem, pink or chocolate-coloured gills and no volva. It grows on soil (often heavily fertilized) or on vegetable debris.

Cap white or cream-coloured, may have fine scales, first hemispherical in shape before flattening out with maturity. The flesh is white, firm and thick. The cap turns yellowish where bruised, and old caps often take on a yellow-brown tinge. Gills are at first pale pink, becoming pink, then chocolate brown or blackish, free and crowded. Stem is white or cream, slightly club-shaped and smooth or finely scaly below the ring. The ring is white or cream, pendulous and superior. Viewed from below, on a closed-cap specimen, it may have a well-developed 'cogwheel' pattern around the stem. Spore print dark purple-brown.

Microscopic Features: The spores are ellipsoidal in shape, with a smooth surface and measuring approximately 6-9碌m in length and 4-6碌m in width.

Note:The mushroom called Horse mushroom in the USA is actually the closely related Agaricus fissuratus, which from a technical, scientific standpoint is a separate species. See Agaricus fissuratus on the MushroomExpert.Com web site.

It becomes later broadly convex and then flattened, sometimes developing a central elevation or umbo. The colour is honey yellow with an orangish tint, gradually transitioning to a cinnamon to brownish-orange shade. As it dries out, the colour often fades noticeably, resulting in a two-toned appearance. In its early stages, the margin may have whitish veil remnants, but it usually becomes bare and finely lined as it matures. Gills typically narrow and crowded, with a broadly adnate to nearly decurrent attachment to the stem and convex edges. They are pallid brown when young, becoming rusty brown or brownish as the spores mature. Stem more or less equal or slightly enlarged downward. The membranous ring is located on the upper half of the stem near the cap but may be sloughed off and missing in older specimens. The fragile stems are often curved. Buff at the apex and browner towards the base and usually longitudinally fibrilose. The basal mycelium is white. Spore print rusty brown.

Microscopic Features: The spores are broadly ellipsoidal, measuring 8-10 by 5-6碌m, and they have a textured surface with small warts.

It also has gills that are pale ochre at first and become cinnamon as the spores mature and a ring on the stem. It grows clustered on stumps and logs of broad-leaf trees, favouring birch. The mushroom can easily be confused with Galerina marginata (Deadly Galerina).

Cap convex, becoming broadly convex or nearly flat, and hygrophanous which means it is changing colour as it dries out and fading from tawny to orangish brown to yellowish or brownish (often passing through a two-toned stage). The cap flesh is pale tan, quite thin and unchanging when sliced. Gills adnate (broadly attached to the stem) and crowded, whitish to pale tan when young, becoming cinnamon brown as the spores mature. Stem pale and smooth above the fairly persistent stem ring, fibrous, scaly and dark tan below, graduating to almost black at the base. Spore print cinnamon brown.

Microscopic Features: The spores of the mushroom are broadly ellipsoidal, and smooth, measuring approximately 5.5-7.5 x 4-5碌m. They possess an apical germ pore.

Cap convex, expanding without fully flattening, often developing a wavy margin, and it is white, smooth, and dry. The flesh is thick and white. Gills crowded, white and adnate or slightly decurrent. Stem coloured as cap, fibrillose, usually slightly swollen at base. It has no ring. Spore print white.

Microscopic Features: Spores are ellipsoidal, smooth, measuring 5.5-7 x 3.2-4.2碌m, and contain oil drops.

Synonyms: Clitocybe connata is a synonym and previously used in some Nordic countries  (including Sweden) for the mushroom. Lyophyllum connatum is an older name.
