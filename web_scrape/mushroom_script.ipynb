They are whitish when very young, but soon turn pale grey to grey, becoming purple-grey to dark purple-brown with maturity. Short gills are frequent. Stem pallid yellowish above but more concolourous with cap towards the base, more or less equal in width, typically curved, smooth. There is no ring present.

It has a bell-shaped to convex cap, which becomes flatter with a broad umbo as it ages. The mushroom belongs to the family Marasmiaceae, which contains about 500 species of agarics. It is widely distributed and commonly found in grassy areas, such as lawns, meadows, and pastures. \\r\\n\\nCap at first convex, then flat to cup-shaped with a low central hump that is often a darker shade. The Colour varies from light beige to brown-yellow. The margins are usually crinkled and almost transparent and streaky in damp weather. They turn lighter in dry weather and regain their colour in more humid conditions. The flesh is whitish buff, thick at the centre, otherwise thin. Gills fairly broad, attached to the stem or free from it, appearing almost distant. They are creamy white at first, becoming ochraceous cream or pale tan in colour. Stem tall, coloured as the cap, smooth or finely scurfy, slender, more or less equal, whitish downy at the base and slightly rooting, stiff. It has no ring. Spore print white.\\r\\n\\nMicroscopic Features: The spores are ellipsoidal to pip-shaped, exhibiting a smooth surface.

The mushroom is mycorrhizal, meaning it forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of pine trees. Suillus luteus can be found in coniferous forests, especially those dominated by pine trees, in various regions around the world.\\r\\n\\nCap chestnut, rusty, olive-brown, or dark brown in colour. It has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off.  Flesh whitish with a yellow tinge, unchanging, moderate and soft, unchanging when cut. Pores tiny, circular, initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like the skin of the cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh. Tubes concolourous with pores, adnate. Stem  pale straw-yellow at first but later darkening, more or less cylindrical but may bear a swollen base. A membranous partial veil initially links the stipe with the edge of the cap. When it ruptures, it forms a membranous, hanging ring with is at first whitish, darkening with age, vinaceous-brown below and large. Spore print ochraceous or buff coloured.\\r\\n\\nMicroscopic Features: Spores are sub-fusiform, exhibiting a smooth surface, with dimensions of approximately 8-10.5μm in length and 3-3.5μm in width.\\r\\n\\nSuillus luteus on the Nature First Web site.\\r\\n\\nSuillus luteus on the MushroomExpert.Com Web site.\\r\\n',\n",

It grows on soil (often heavily fertilized) or on vegetable debris.\\r\\n\\nCap white or cream-coloured, may have fine scales, first hemispherical in shape before flattening out with maturity. The flesh is white, firm and thick. The cap turns yellowish where bruised, and old caps often take on a yellow-brown tinge. Gills are at first pale pink, becoming pink, then chocolate brown or blackish, free and crowded. Stem is white or cream, slightly club-shaped and smooth or finely scaly below the ring. The ring is white or cream, pendulous and superior. Viewed from below, on a closed-cap specimen, it may have a well-developed 'cogwheel' pattern around the stem. Spore print dark purple-brown.\\r\\n\\nMicroscopic Features: The spores are ellipsoidal in shape, with a smooth surface and measuring approximately 6-9µm in length and 4-6µm in width.\\r\\n\\nNote:The mushroom called Horse mushroom in the USA is actually the closely related Agaricus fissuratus, which from a technical, scientific standpoint is a separate species. See Agaricus fissuratus on the MushroomExpert.Com web site.\\r\\n\\nAgaricus arvensis on the www.first-nature.com web site.\\r\\n\", 'agaricus_arvensis']\n"
